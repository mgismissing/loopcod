End User License Agreement (EULA) for all StopCod applications and tools

First Part: LoopCod DNA Editor
With the LoopCod DNA Editor you can easily create and simulate an organism from scratch.
You must read these rules just to make sure you follow them correctly:
1. No Hacking/Exploiting: Hacking the application or seeing the application's code is forbidden.
2. No stolen Product Keys: You can't use another person's Product Key. It is seen as stealing and
can be punished in many ways depending from your country.

Second Part: Cell Builder
The cell builder is seen as an extension to the present LoopCod DNA Editor, as it can be used to
create samples of cells you created in real life. We need to know what you create as it could be
dangerous, so you need to follow these rules:
1. You must make sure that your project is public to our website before proceeding.
2. No Hacking/Exploiting: As the cell builder can only create cells that are public to everyone on
our official website to ensure security, it is forbidden to hack or take advantage of not fixed bugs
to create harmful organisms. Remember: this is not a game. It is real life.

Third Part: Publishing your project online
You must follow these simple rules:
1. No Fake Websites: You are only allowed to publish your project to our official website.
2. No Harmful For Natural (HFN) organisms: You cannot upload harmful organisms as they get
rejected by our admin team and you get a warning. After three warnings your access to the website
is revoked and depending from what you uploaded your Product Key will be disabled.

Fourth Part: General Info
You cannot use this piece of software to do illegal activities and you can't sell Product Keys online.
The product key you're selling will be instantly disabled by our team.

So now with a basic understanding of what you can and can't do... Let's get coding!
